# 🧪 QA Portfolio – Ruby Iranon

Welcome to my QA portfolio!
I am an independent Quality Assurance Engineer who takes full ownership of testing projects — from planning and test case design to bug reporting and automation. I build QA processes from scratch, ensuring software quality and reliability at every stage.

## 🌱 My QA Journey
I began my QA journey by exploring how systems work and how to ensure they meet user expectations. Working independently on every project, I learned to manage all aspects of QA — planning, testing, reporting, and automation — without relying on a dedicated QA team. This experience has made me resourceful, self-driven, and detail-oriented.
